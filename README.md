# cc-create-elevator
a elevator made using create and computercraft (the code is probably unoptimized idk)
also the world thing wont work unless you have v0.5 of oykko's modpack which can be imported using the curseforge profile

the v0.5 import the profile into curseforge put the world in and just click play and it should work fine
