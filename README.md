# cc-create-elevator
a elevator made using create and computercraft (the code is probably unoptimized idk)
also the world thing wont work unless you have v0.5 of oykko's modpack which can be imported using the curseforge profile 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Sgb4gPGFwtthFd9_TZ84iAVkIYmAS9Cw?usp=share_link this is the link to the profile just download
the v0.5 import the profile into curseforge put the world in and just click play and it should work fine

if you want this to work in a different world just follow what the world has but just use ```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git-oykko/cc-create-elevator/main/main.lua``` on the main computer and ```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git-oykko/cc-create-elevator/main/floorlua``` on the mover one
